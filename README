Project by Elijah Gray

Technical Achievements:
    Styled page with CSS: Added rules for body and subsections such as h1,h2,h3.
    added a little image based on an example I found online. I figured out how to move it around on the page and adjust qualities. I also studied why it worked.
    added interesting semantics like <footer>, used <a> for a hyperlink on a piece of text for the github page, added bulleted points, added a collapsible for the work experience section.

Design Achievements:
    Used colors from a color palette provided by Adobe.
    Used an imported font from google fonts. I used a retro looking font called Press Start 2P.
    reorganized the code to make it appear a lot cleaner. Tried to use good practices by offloading much of the specifics to a style sheet.

AI usage:
    Initially I wanted to make my phrasing sound better for the about me section but I ended up re-doing it cause it sounded way too corporate for my liking. I asked gemini to
    provide examples of how people use CSS with HTML and javascript. I asked it to explain why people did the things they did from the textbook. I asked some questions about syntax.

Resource usage and citations:
    A variety of links were provided and included in comments to show where I had learned to do things from online resources. One particularly useful example was a picture display example.
