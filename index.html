    <h1>Information about Elijah Gray</h1>
    <p>
        Hello! I am 25. I am passionate about learning, but I tend to like jumping from one thing to another, so I consider myself a little bit of a jack of all trades.
        I am technically from the class of 2027, but I am graduating "early" as I am a transfer student. I first attended at
        Quinsigamond community college out of pocket for most of my time there hence why it has taken me a bit longer. I've been dabbling with computer since I was 9 years old.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pursuing a BS in computer science.
    </p>
    <p>
      I personally have been both diagnosed with ADHD and autism; however, most people cannot tell as I tend to fairly good as masking. I am a big supporter of mental health and advocating for those with disabilities.
      I was awarded as a top computer science student of my class in both high school and my previous college.

    <h2>Experience</h2>
    <p>

    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
          I have minimal experience with HTML, CSS, and JS as I tended to focus more on back-end oriented courses. I have experience with Python, but it is not as strong as my C/C++ experience.
          I have much experience doing unit testing and refactoring, as that was a big part of my object-oriented design course. I also have experience doing both whitebox
          and blackbox testing.
      </li>
      <li>
          I have been able to work alongside doing schoolwork for some time. My first job was at Quinsigamond Community College to work on a robotics project for the pepper robot, which did use some web design elements.
          I have also had the opportunity to work with Ahattek.INC One example of a project I did for this company was a full stack system-level integration to UI interface program for the battery monitoring system for one of their custom-made drone controllers.
          I am also currently taking advanced computer networks.
      </li>
      <li>
          Being a senior, I have taken many courses at WPI.  Courses I have taken: Software engineering, Algorithms, Operating Systems, Mobile and Ubiquitous computing, Object-Oriented design principles, Intro to artificial intelligence, databases 1, machine learning, and computer networks.
