<h1>Information about Elijah Gray</h1>
<p>
    Hello! I am 25. I am technically from the class of 2027, but I am graduating "early" as I am a transfer student. I
    first attended Quinsigamond community college out of pocket for most of my time there hence why it has taken me a
    bit longer. I've been dabbling with computers since I was 9 years old, so I still remember floppy disks.
</p>
<p>
    Pursuing a BS in computer science.
</p>
<p>
    I have been diagnosed with ADHD and autism; however, most people cannot tell, as I am fairly good at masking.
    I am an advocate for mental health and hope to uplift those struggling with disabilities.
    I was recognized as a top computer science student in both high school and college.
    Despite these accolades I consider myself fairly average and always find myself learning from my peers.
</p>

    <ul>

        <li>
            I have minimal experience with HTML, CSS, and JS as I tended to focus more on back-end oriented courses. I
            have experience with Python, but it is not as strong as my C/C++ experience.
            I have much experience doing unit testing and refactoring, as that was a big part of my object-oriented
            design course. I also have experience doing both whitebox
            and blackbox testing.
        </li>

        <li>
            I have been able to work alongside doing schoolwork for some time. My first job was at Quinsigamond
            Community College to work on a robotics project for the pepper robot, which did use some web design
            elements.
            I have also had the opportunity to work with Ahattek.INC. One example of a project I did for this company was
            a full stack system-level integration to UI interface program for the battery monitoring system for one of
            their custom-made drone controllers.
        </li>

        <li>
            Being a senior, I have taken many courses at WPI. Some CS courses I have taken at WPI are: Software
            engineering, Algorithms, Operating Systems, Mobile and Ubiquitous computing, Object-Oriented design
            principles, Intro to artificial intelligence, databases 1, machine learning, and computer networks. I am
            also currently taking advanced computer networks.
