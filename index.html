    <h1>Information about Elijah Gray</h1>
    <p>
        Hello! I am 25. I am technically from the class of 2027, but I am graduating "early" as I am a transfer student. I first attended Quinsigamond community college out of pocket for most of my time there hence why it has taken me a bit longer. I've been dabbling with computers since I was 9 years old, so I still remember floppy disks.
        I would say im naturally curious and enjoy understanding systems from multiple angles. Iâ€™ve learned to channel my ADHD's hyperfocus into deep, focused work when necessary.

      Pursuing a BS in computer science.
    </p>
    <p>
        I have been diagnosed with ADHD and autism; however, most people cannot tell, as I am fairly good at masking.
        I am an advocate for mental health and hope to uplift those struggling with disabilities.
        I was recognized as a top computer science student in both high school and college.
        Despite these accolades, I consider myself fairly average and always strive to learn from my peers.

    <h2>Experience</h2>

    <ul>
      <li>
          I have minimal experience with HTML, CSS, and JS as I tended to focus more on back-end oriented courses. I have experience with Python, but it is not as strong as my C/C++ experience.
          I have much experience doing unit testing and refactoring, as that was a big part of my object-oriented design course. I also have experience doing both whitebox
          and blackbox testing.
      </li>
      <li>
          I have been able to work alongside doing schoolwork for some time. My first job was at Quinsigamond Community College to work on a robotics project for the pepper robot, which did use some web design elements.
          I have also had the opportunity to work with Ahattek.INC One example of a project I did for this company was a full stack system-level integration to UI interface program for the battery monitoring system for one of their custom-made drone controllers.
          I am also currently taking advanced computer networks.
      </li>
      <li>
          Being a senior, I have taken many courses at WPI. Some CS courses I have taken at WPI are: Software engineering, Algorithms, Operating Systems, Mobile and Ubiquitous computing, Object-Oriented design principles, Intro to artificial intelligence, databases 1, machine learning, and computer networks.
